# unity3d-package-utils

Utility functionality for unity3d-package's to ease access to package assets and generated
data assets.


## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add rotorz/unity3d-package-utils
```

This package is compatible with the [unity3d-package-syncer][tool] tool. Refer to the
tools' [README][tool] for information on syncing packages into a Unity project.

[tool]: https://github.com/rotorz/unity3d-package-syncer


## Accessing read-only assets from a package

Assets that are synchronized using `unity3d-package-syncer` can be accessed in a read-only
fashion since they are nuked each time the package is updated or re-installed.

Resolve asset paths (the one's that start with "Assets/"):

```csharp
Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPath("@vendor-name/my-package-name", "Language", "en-US.txt"));
// Assets/Plugins/Packages/@vendor-name/my-package-name/Language/en-US.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPath("@vendor-name/my-package-name", null, "Foo.txt"));
// Assets/Plugins/Packages/@vendor-name/my-package-name/Foo.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPath("my-package-name", null, "Foo.txt"));
// Assets/Plugins/Packages/my-package-name/Foo.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPath("my-package-name"));
// Assets/Plugins/Packages/my-package-name
```

Resolve absolute paths of directories and files (file system paths):

```csharp
Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPathAbsolute("@vendor-name/my-package-name", "Language", "en-US.txt"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\Packages\@vendor-name\my-package-name\Language\en-US.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPathAbsolute("@vendor-name/my-package-name", null, "Foo.txt"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\Packages\@vendor-name\my-package-name\Foo.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPathAbsolute("my-package-name", null, "Foo.txt"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\Packages\my-package-name\Foo.txt

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.ResolveAssetPathAbsolute("my-package-name"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\Packages\my-package-name
```


## Accessing mutable data assets for a package

Data assets that are generated by a package should be saved into the associated data path
so that they survive after the package is updated or re-installed.

Get asset paths (the one's that start with "Assets/"); missing directories are
automatically created so that data assets can be saved into them. If you want to resolve a
data asset path but don't want to create any missing directories, then you should use the
`ResolveDataAssetPath` and `ResolveDataAssetPathAbsolute` functions instead.

```csharp
Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPath("@vendor-name/my-package-name", "Presets", "NewPreset.asset"));
// Assets/Plugins/PackageData/@vendor-name/my-package-name/Presets/NewPreset.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPath("@vendor-name/my-package-name", null, "ProjectSettings.asset"));
// Assets/Plugins/PackageData/@vendor-name/my-package-name/ProjectSettings.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPath("my-package-name", null, "ProjectSettings.asset"));
// Assets/Plugins/PackageData/my-package-name/ProjectSettings.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPath("my-package-name"));
// Assets/Plugins/PackageData/my-package-name
```

Get absolute paths of directories and files (file system paths):

```csharp
Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPathAbsolute("@vendor-name/my-package-name", "Presets", "NewPreset.asset"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\PackageData\@vendor-name\my-package-name\Presets\NewPreset.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPathAbsolute("@vendor-name/my-package-name", null, "ProjectSettings.asset"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\PackageData\@vendor-name\my-package-name\ProjectSettings.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPathAbsolute("my-package-name", null, "ProjectSettings.asset"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\PackageData\my-package-name\ProjectSettings.asset

Debug.Log(PackageUtility.GetDataAssetPathAbsolute("my-package-name"));
// C:\MyProject\Assets\Plugins\PackageData\my-package-name
```
